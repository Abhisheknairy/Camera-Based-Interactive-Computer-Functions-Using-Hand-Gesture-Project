# Camera-Based-Interactive-Computer-Functions-Using-Hand-Gesture-Project
This project creates an interactive system for controlling computer functions via hand gestures detected by a camera. Using computer vision and machine learning, the system recognizes gestures to perform actions like controlling the mouse cursor, managing a music player, and navigating presentations. 

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect and interpret hand gestures in real-time.
- **Mouse Cursor Control**: Allows users to move and interact with the mouse cursor through gestures.
- **Music Player Management**: Enables users to play, pause, skip tracks, and adjust volume using specific gestures.
- **Presentation Navigation**: Facilitates hands-free navigation through slides and interactive elements during presentations.
- **Applications**: Suitable for a wide range of applications including virtual reality, gaming, accessibility for disabled individuals, and touchless interfaces.
