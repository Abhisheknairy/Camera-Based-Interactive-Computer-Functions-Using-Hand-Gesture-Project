# Camera-Based-Interactive-Computer-Functions-Using-Hand-Gesture-Project
This project creates an interactive system for controlling computer functions via hand gestures detected by a camera. Using computer vision and machine learning, the system recognizes gestures to perform actions like controlling the mouse cursor, managing a music player, and navigating presentations.
